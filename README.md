## Instruction
1. Create database using file ___data_colection.m___ - change path for each gestures - example gestures have been placed in ___sample___ folder
2. Run file ___hand_gest_recognition_train.m___ for train the Net 
3. Run file ___hand_gest_recognition_test.m___ for testing trained the Net.
4. If you wanna see confusion matrix run ___Confusion_matrix.m___ - for better result can you create your own dataset for test
